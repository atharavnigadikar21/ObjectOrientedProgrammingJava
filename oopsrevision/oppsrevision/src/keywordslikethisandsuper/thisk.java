// Referring to Instance Variables: The this keyword helps distinguish

// Calling a Constructor from Another Constructor: this can be used to call one constructor
//  from another in the same class (constructor chaining).

// Referring to the Current Object: It can be used to pass
//  the current object as an argument in method calls or constructors.

// Returning the Current Object: this can be returned from a method 
// to allow method chaining or return the current class instance.

// Invoking Current Class Methods: You can use this to call another
//  method within the same class.
